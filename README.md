# blocky
A content-blocking extension designed to block virtually all images/media

The philosophy of this extension is to limit downloaded data as much as possible.  The internet is so chock full of dumb stuff these days, that you might as well just block all images and media.  That's what this blocker does.  The one exception is images from Twitter's image server, which makes the mobile Twitter site work fairly normally.  If, for whatever reason, you really really wanna see all the internet BS, simply tap-and-hold on the reload button in Safari's search bar, and then select "reload and ignore content blockers".

This blocker is best combined with limiting cookies in Safari to "the current website only".
